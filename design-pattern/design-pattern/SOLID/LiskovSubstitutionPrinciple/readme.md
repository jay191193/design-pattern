# Liskov Subtitution Principle
## Two important terms: _subtyping relation_ and _strong behavioral subtyping_.
## Definition: Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Explanation:
- Whenever we have parent child relationship in the code and if we are able to implement a code such that code for parent class is replaceable with the code of child class without breaking the application, then we have to do that as per this principle.
